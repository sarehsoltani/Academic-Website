I was recently graduated from B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Tehran.
I am also a Research Assistant in IoT Research Center of AUT.<br>

My research interests broadly focus on Internet of things, Wireless Networks and Machine Learning.
Specificly , I am interested in the applications of Internet of Things for Smart Cities, Smart homes and Healthcare.<br>

I also had the opportunity to be a Teaching Assistant to some of our department's greatest professors on the courses that I was very interested in.<br>
I passed high school and junior high school at NODET (National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents).
